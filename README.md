# Pore Pressure Prediction In Northern Carnarvon Basin

This project employs machine learning models to predict pore pressure in the Northern Carnarvon Basin. Utilizing advanced computational methods and comprehensive geological data, it aims to enhance precision for informed decision-making in drilling and reservoir management within the region's petroleum industry.

## Executive Summary

The main focus of this study is to evaluate machine learning models in predicting pore pressure values, which is a crucial aspect of drilling operations. The goal is to create strong machine-learning models by leveraging drilling data, with a specific emphasis on target pore pressure. Once developed, these models will play a pivotal role in predicting pore pressure with high accuracy. The ultimate aim is to implement these models as valuable tools to guide and optimize future drilling activities, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.

The objective of this project is to explore the Northern Carnarvon Basin. The accompanying image highlights the research area's geographical boundaries, with a particular focus on the Rankin Platform. The study's primary points of interest are the WILCOX-1 well, WILCOX-2 well, and GOODWYN-6, all of which are critical areas of investigation in this comprehensive study.

## Machine Laerning Modeling

## Conclusion

*  The prediction analysis involves training and testing on two wells, WILCOX-1 and WILCOX-2, with GOODWYN-6 designated for blind testing.
*  Three models, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest, and XGBoost were used for prediction.
*  Before tuning hyperparameters, Random Forest achieved superior performance with an R2 score of 0.9997.
*  After hyperparameter tuning, the Multi-Layer Perceptron was identified as the optimal model, achieving an improved R2 score of 0.9998.
*  During the blind test of the GOODWYN-6 well, the Multi-Layer Perceptron achieved an exceptional R2 score of 0.9999, demonstrating its superior predictive capability.
