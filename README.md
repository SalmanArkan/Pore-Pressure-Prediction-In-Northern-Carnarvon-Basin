# Pore Pressure Prediction In Northern Carnarvon Basin

This project employs machine learning models to predict pore pressure in the Northern Carnarvon Basin. Utilizing advanced computational methods and comprehensive geological data, it aims to enhance precision for informed decision-making in drilling and reservoir management within the region's petroleum industry.

## Executive Summary

## Methodology

## Data Collection

## Pre-processing

## Machine Laerning Modeling

## Conclusion

*  Two wells (WILCOX-1 & WILCOX-2) are used for prediction and one well (GOODWYN-6) for blind test.
*  Three models that are used for the prediction of Multi-Layer Perceptron, Random Forest, and XGBoost indicate the best modeling.
*  Based on three models before using hyperparameter tuning, Random Forest has the best prediction with an R2 score is 0.9997.
*  Based on three models after using hyperparameter tuning, Multi-Layer Perceptro has the best prediction with an R2 score is 0.9998.
*  For blind tests using GOODWYN-6 well, the Multi-Layer Perceptro has the best prediction with an R2 score is 0.9999.
